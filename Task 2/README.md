<h3><strong>Car Price Prediction With Machine Learning</strong></h3>
<hr>
The price of a car depends on a lot of factors like the goodwill of the brand of the car, features of the car, horsepower and the mileage it gives and many more. Car price prediction is one of the major research areas in machine learning. So if you want to learn how to train a car price prediction model then this article is for you. In this article, I will take you through how to train a car price prediction model with machine learning using Python.

One of the main areas of research in machine learning is the prediction of the price of cars. It is based on finance and the marketing domain. It is a major research topic in machine learning because the price of a car depends on many factors. Some of the factors that contribute a lot to the price of a car are:
<br><ul>
<li>Brand</li>
<li>Symboling</li>
<li>Wheelbase</li>
<li>Carlength</li>
<li>Carwidth</li>
<li>Carheight</li>
<li>Curbweight</li>
<li>Enginesize</li>
<li>Boreratio</li>
<li>Stroke</li>
<li>Compressionratio</li>
<li>Horsepower</li>
<li>Peakrpm</li>
<li>and many more.</li>
</ul>

If we ignores the brand of the car, a car manufacturer primarily fixes the price of a car based on the features it can offer a customer. Later, the brand may raise the price depending on its goodwill, but the most important factors are what features a car gives you to add value to your life. So, in the section below, we will ignore the brand of the car.
